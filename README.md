# CSVClusteringAlgorithm
Runs clustering algorithm on an imported CSV dataset


<ul>This program reads in life expectancy and birth rate data from either 1953 or 2008 (the two available datasets)</ul>
<ul>It will then perform a cluster analysis (the user determines the number of clusters to use)</ul>
<ul>It also produces a graph to help choose the optimum number of clusters</ul>
<ul>Information is printed on the number of countries per cluster, each of these countries is then printed out, and mean birth rates and life expectancy is provided</ul>
